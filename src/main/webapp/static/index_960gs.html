			<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
				text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
				BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
				professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
				the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
				passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
				literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
				from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
				Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
				amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

			<p>Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by
				Cicero in 45 BC "Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit
				voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam,
				eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto
				beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia
				voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur
				magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro
				facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor
				repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut
				rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint
				et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a
				sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias
				consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat." 1914
				translation by H. Rackham "On the other hand, we denounce with
				righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
				demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
				desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
				to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
				through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
				shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and
				easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
				untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we
				like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
				But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
				obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
				to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
				always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
				rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he
				endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
