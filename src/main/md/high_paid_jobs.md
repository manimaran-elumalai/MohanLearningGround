* Salary is also based on location, and "demand and supply"
* Average developer in niche programming (Haskell/Scala/F#) paid higer, because there are simply fewer of them
* Salary is in direct correlation to your expertise and knowledge how to solve (particular) problems and achieve business goals
* People are paid according to how replaceable they are
* A programmer wants to judge himself/herself by a single language then they're already replaceable
* Being subject-matter expert in a area where industry has highest demand would be a boon. (Ex: Machine learning expert in 2015~2027)
