* [Conentration]
* [Swami Sarvapriyananda-"Secret of Concentration" at IIT Kanpur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGswR0tMqCM)
* We are 128 bit per secon, whenn focus a lot, we will ignore everything else like hunger, weather, senses. Becuase there is no bandwidth
* Quality of life
  * But life depends on quality of experience
  * But experience depends on quality  of conentration
* We all have limited cognitive capacity

## Flow : is a function that involves Skill, Challenge and produces new state
* Flow : (Skill, Challenge) => State 
* Concentraion: directly proportionate to mental purity (uncomplicated life is mental purity)
* Kama (pleasure), Artha (money, success, awards, promotion), we need them instinctively. But they should be regulated by Dharna (Morality)
* Pamara = [(Kama + Artha) - Moral] ~~> Produces unpleasant life
* Visayi = [(Kama + Artha) + Moral] ~~> Leads life within bounds, and laws
* Gandhi, Anna Hasare, Social Workers = [(Moksha + Dharma) - Karma - Artha ] ~~> Gives up personal gain, works for wellfare of thers.
 

## Flow requires followings
 * Requires high level of skill
 * Requires difficult activity
 * Action and awareness merging (Absorbed into the scientific work and forget about himself)
 * Clear goal should be there
 * For research, we may not have goal, but aware what goal we try to achieve
 * Feedback


## How does it feel to be in flow
 * Completely involved in what you are doing- focused, concentrated. Even lossing other senses (hot, hungry, time)
 * A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality
 * Great inner clarity knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing (feedback)
 * A sense of serenity - no worries about oneselft, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the  ego
 * Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes its own reward
 * Timelessness - thoroughly focused one the present, hours seem to pass by in minutes


## Vivekananda
* **Vivekananda was able to read entire volume of "Encyclopedia Britanica" and able to answer the questions**
 * He also mentioned that with meditation (and concentration) and purity, anybody can do it.
 * He also symbolised Snake for concentration
 * Learn the power of detachment
 * Detachment should be practicsed, detach from all the other issues.
 * Education is all about power of concentration.
* Nepolean opens the drawyer of issue and close all the other drawyer, don't worry and confuse with other drawyer

## Natural concentration
* When you watch movie and cricket
 * We don't fee discomfort
 * Won't feel hungry
 * When you are deeply obsorbed you won't notice other senses feedback

## Challenges vs skills
* Arousel (ready to face challenge) (Highest challenge, moderate skill)
* Anxiety (Highest challenge, lower than moderate skill)
* Worry (Moderate challenge, lower skill)
* Apathy (Lower challenge, lower skill)
* ---
* Boredom  (Lower challenge, moderate skill)
* Relaxation (Lower challenge, highest skill)
* Control (moderate challenge, highest skill)
* Flow (Highest skill and highest challenge)

## Vivekananda About Goal
* Goal should have an end. Find what is the end (To complete IIT, find highest paying job in the world)
* Forget the end and focus on the means
* Keep on thinking about final goal won't help
* Clear goals are necessary for flow, without clear goals we will end up in Anxiety
* 

## Flow and Yoga
* Start with  right posture, sit straight. Don't lean forward like sleeping or releaxed
* Do pranayama - concentration will make breathing in both nostril
  * Can try with "Nadi suddhi pranayama" 
* Arouse curiosity, setup a problem and read material so you will be curious and concentrate more.
* Avoid polluted, noisy area and try to withdraw from rest of the world.
* Focus (Dharana)
  * Be active reader, mark and do underline, place your question, write what you agree, disagree
* Stay on unbroken focus (Dhyana)

## Yoga
