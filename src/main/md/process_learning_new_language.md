# Learning process
* Watch children's shows in that language. They speak slower and often more simply.
* What to learn in new language?
  * Vocabulary, pronunciation and Grammar
  * Read, Listen, Write and Speak - Are skills
* Out of all the resources suggested to us, pick one, and stick with it. Do the whole thing.
* Grab Spaced repetition software (anki, just download anki), and make your own flashcards. Do not use cards that you have not made.
  * "Fluent Forever" by Gabriel Wynar
* Pick some introductory text book. It can be anything to old college textbooks, and read one chapter a day.
  * For french, use Assimil French with Ease book
* Practice pronunciation. Learn the IPA and how to shape your mouth. 
  * For french, Gabriel Wynar, the Fluent Forever author, has a three video series on Youtube that covers French phonetics.
* Flashcards should be used daily
* It's also important that you actually study. Once you have your material that you choose, get off of internet. Stop looking up ways to study efficiently, and just put the man hours in.
* Even after learning we may afraid to actually use it, better use it using softwares like iTalki
* Use duolingo

# What to learn
* phonetics
* phonemes


# Make a (SMART) plan and try to stick to that
* Learn 20 words a day, and will know 500 words before dd.mm.yyyy.
* Learn how to pronunce 10 dialogue, and will know 200 dialogue before dd.mm.yyyy.
* Learn to write 3 lines a day, and wrote 100 statements before dd.mm.yyyy.


# Expose yourself to unknown things in the language. 
* Listen to podcasts.
* Watch movies with subtitles on or off, and repeat the dialogue
* Read a children's book
* Set your browser for a few minutes of surfing in French.
* Read their newspapers
* Video game languages to French
* Never try to learn by watching a foreign movie with English subtitles. 
 * The subtitles should always be in the language of the video and the language you are learning. 
 * You need to learn to think in the language, not translate it into English (or enything else). This is a common mistake.
